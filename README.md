## Features

- Based on [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) (by [DropBox](https://github.com/dropbox)).
- Password strength is labeled as 'Weak', 'Could be stronger' and 'Strong'.
- Customizable display modes.
- Compatible with `nearata/flarum-ext-signup-confirm-password`.

## Installation

```bash
composer require glowingblue/password-strength
```

## Updating

```bash
composer update glowingblue/password-strength
php flarum cache:clear
```

## Conflicts
- `glowingblue/password-strength` doesn't work with `therealsujitk/flarum-ext-show-password` which can be removed, as `glowingblue/password-strength` adds a very similar functionality.

## Usage

Just enable the extension and customize if you wish.

## ToDo

- I have no idea about how to implement it inside the reset password blade but you're very welcome to guide me or open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/glowingblue/flarum-ext-password-strength).
